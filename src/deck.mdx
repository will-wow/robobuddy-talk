# Web VR For All

## Cross-platform 3D Apps with A-Frame

will@ae.studio | [github.com/will-wow](http://github.com/will-wow)

<Notes>

- Thanks for coming. Today we're going to look into A-Frame, a tool for building 3D experiences on the web, especially for VR and now AR, and some best practices for building experiences that work across devices.

# Lunch With AE Studio

<Notes>

- But first, welcome to the first of a lunch talk series!
- Thanks for trying out Stream. If this goes well, we can use this to reach a wider audience with these talks
- But for now, let's talk about VR

</Notes>

# It's 2020. How's VR doing?

<Img src={vrTrend} />

<Notes>

- VR has been the next big thing for a while now.
- It's not quite there yet,
- Steam recently reported crossing over 1m monthly users
- That's a big audience!

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

# But that's just 1.92% of Steam users

</Invert>

<Notes>

- But even though a lot of people have a headset, by far most people don't

</Notes>

# What does this mean for VR in 2020?

- VR is attention-grabbing and has dedicated users
- Most people will not see your VR app
- What if you want to play with VR but reach a wide audience?
- And you work for, say, a web development company?

---

# Enter A-Frame

<Img src={aframeLogo} alt="A-Frame Logo" />

<Notes>

- then do I have the framework for you, imaginary target audience!

# A-Frame

- WebVR framework
- Released by Mozilla in 2015
- Under active development
- This year added AR support with the WebXR standard

<Notes>

- WebVR
- Based on Three.js
- instead of low-level framework, put together a 3D webapp with html elements and some JS
- Mozilla project released in 2015, so if VR was 5 years away then... oops?
- This year the browser WebVR standard changed
- Now WebXR, supports mobile AR
- Also broke Aframe 1.0.3, so make sure to only use 1.0.4, because web standards
- But that's why we use frameworks

<Notes>

- Here is an embedded Aframe app
- Sort of the hello world of 3D.
- Got some shapes, can click and drag, cool.
- How do you make that?

<Notes>

- Yeah there's really not much to it
- A-Frame adds some HTML tags that let you describe this scene pretty declaratively
- Position is relative to parent

);
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- And because I know you'll like this
- Here's the same component in React!
- There's an officially supported React wrapper.
- It's really nice for state management
- easy to misuse, performance problems

</Notes>

# Make it do something!

<Notes>

- making shapes is cool, but they should probably move or something

</Notes>

# ECS

- Entity: Elements like `<a-box>` or `<a-entity>`
- Component: Attributes like `position` or `laser-controls`
- System: Inter-component singletons like `aabb-collider`

<Notes>

- A-Frame uses the Entity Component System model from games
- Entities are the raw containers, like boxes, cylinder, and the div of aframe, a-entity.
  - They may have a simple shape, otherwise don't do much
- Components are the workhorse of A-Frame. You assign them as HTML attributes
  - but first you register them
  - a component is a little class that has access to the underlying THree.js object
  - takes props
  - has lifecycle methods like update and tick
- Finally a System is a singleton that every component with a matching name has access to
  - for instance, there's an `aabb-collider` component that lets you do simple collision detection.
  - Everything with `aabb-collider` on it has access to the collider system, which calculates collisions.

</Notes>

<CodeSurfer theme={dracula}>

```javascript title="A Door Component"
AFRAME.registerComponent("door", {
  schema: {
    open: { type: "boolean", default: false },
  }
  update(oldData) {
    if (oldData.open === this.data.open) return;

    if (this.data.open) {
      this.playOpenSound();
    } else {
      this.playCloseSound();
    }
  },
  tick(time, delta) {
    if (this.data.open) {
      this.open(delta);
    } else {
      this.close(delta);
    }
  }
});

```

```diff 5:13 subtitle="On Update, play a sound"

```

```diff 14:20 subtitle="Do something 90 times a second"

```

<Notes>

- there are other methods, like on destroy
- You can also set up event listeners in here for click, collision, or whatever

# Why WebVR?

- Cross-platform
- Ease of distributution
- Familiar language

---

# Cross-Platform 3D

- Desktop
- Mobile magic window
- 3DoF (Go & Cardboard)
- 6DoF (Vive, Rift)

<Notes>

- Four main cases

# Okay enough talk, want to meet a robot?

<iframe src="https://robobuddy.surge.sh" height="75%" width="75%" />

<Notes>

- This is Robobuddy, a little A-Frame friend I've been messing with on the weekends
- Chases a laser pointer like a cat
- State machine light
  - see what he's thinking with light on head
  - helpful for debugging!
- Uses Builtin and community Superframe components
  - Arches, Walk, Look, Laser RayCaster, hand controls
- For this talk, focus on the UI
- click Escape, Recall, Sound, Play
- This is a flat webbrowser, we have tools for UIs there, use them
- Responsive to mobile, in-game menus could get cut off
- Hover state and other nice things
- But this won't work in VR
- Okay have to say bye to go to the next slide now

# VR is different

<Notes>

- so right, VR is different
- No DOM elements
- not responsive
- HUD is considered bad practice
- Floating things not normal, and comfort and immersivemess are important
- May change with AR
- So while the two ControlPanels can share the events they emit and their logic
- Render totally differently
- Either in-universe buttons (on a table, UI on the walls)
- Or on-arm
- One way i've seen before is a UI when you turn over hand

</Notes>

---

<BgImage src={handControl} />

<Notes>

- I liked that, so that's how the controls show in VR here
- Notice there's no Play, since it doesn't make sense to pause in VR
- There is a little math involved, but pretty basic (after a lot of googleing about Euler angles and vectors and looking at my hand)
- Could also pull a panel from your arm or something
- This is a more immersive way to do things

</Notes>

---

<BgImage src={comeHere} />

<Notes>

- I added support for physically pressing the buttons
- Feels good, but doesn't work for Cardboard or Go
- Instead also support a raycaster
- And bonus, A-Frame turns raycaster into click events for ease of use

</Notes>

---

# Things to keep in mind

- 0, 1 or 2 Hands
- 3 or 6 Degrees of freedom
- Raycasters
- Discoverability
- Handedness
- Physical Comfort

---

# Wrapping up: use cases

- Asymmetric experiences
- VR/PC collaboration & games
- Tech demos
- Prototypes

---

# Now go build something cool!
